# Solara ‚òÄÔ∏èüåô
A game that tests eternal love and longingness for one another, as well as the key to building a successful relationship despite multiple shortcomings and hardships.

# Synopsis üîç
You and a friend play as two characters:

Solis, a powerful yet agile character that symbolizes the sun and all of its eternal light. He specializes in speed and light, and some of his abilties include the Sunflare Dash, Radiant Boost, and a Sizzling Lance. His romantic interest is Lunae, a celestial princess whom I will discuss about soon.

Lunae, a celestial princess who is a strategic, ranged, and very control based fighter. She utilizes water and gravity to neutralize threats, although her favorite thing to use is electricity because of how much she overthinks (brain gets fried a lot :).
Although she has water abilities such as Tidal Wave and Moonblade Throw, she hates it because of its hydrating ability, and instead prefers to use her icy abilities, including a Frozen Lance.

They can both use combo attacks to neutralize much more elemental enemies such as ice and electric, such as Solar Frost Nova, a mainly icy attack, and a Steam Surge attack to affect electric enemies.

Navigate through this storytelling journey through plains, storms, and caverns, as Solis and Lunae battle through hardships in the form of ice, water, electric, and fire enemies to not only discover their unique journey, but how despite multiple arguments and tension rising, two lovers that truly love one another cannot ever be drawn apart. 

Enjoy, and let me know what you think.
